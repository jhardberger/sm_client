**BeatGrinder** is my attempt to create a more organic music discovery experience. It's a full-stack app built with React and Node.js that makes extensive use of the Spotify API. 

A user can log in with their Spotify account and create "grinds": never-ending playlists that can then be customized using the musical qualities that Spotify assigns, behind the scenes, to every song. 

Think of a it as a responsive radio station that lets you set the vibe.

This app is currently not deployed, but if you'd like to get a sense of how it works, you can clone this repo and the backend: https://github.com/jhardberger/sm_api

To get things started with a Mongo server, NPM start the front-end, run the back-end with Nodemon, and run the Auth server (also back-end) with the command node auth/authorization_code/app.js
